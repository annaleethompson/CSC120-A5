- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My inital impression of how association affect your programing is that it makes it a lot easier to connect individal classes. Additionally, being able to have different types of relationships makes creating or applying certain functions less difficult. For someone taking this course in the future, I would say to go in the order of the instructions. I think that if I had tried to writch things up and start with a different class I would have been way more confused, but I was able to build off of the code I wrote in my previous classes to build the new ones. Additionally, I started early and attended tutoring hours multiple times which always helps.
